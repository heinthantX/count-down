Just practice learned things: setTimeOut, setInterval with DOM. I tried to build event count down part of a website.

You can see [DEMO HERE](https://heinthantx.github.io/count-down)

### Built with

The whole template is built with

- HTML
- CSS
- TailwindCss
- JavaScript

### Animation explanation

I used setInterval() to count the time.

Just use css animation for rotating clock and add animation and remove the animation after a delay with setTimeout() in every interval.
